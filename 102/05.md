# CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language that is used to describe the presentation of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and XML (Extensible Markup Language) documents. CSS works by applying styles to HTML and XML elements, which allow you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page.

Here's a high-level overview of how CSS works:

CSS selectors: Selectors are used to target HTML and XML elements that you want to style. CSS selectors can be based on element names, class names, IDs, attributes, and more.

CSS properties: CSS properties are used to define the style of the targeted HTML and XML elements. Examples of CSS properties include color, font-size, margin, padding, background-color, and many more.

CSS values Values are used to specify the exact settings for a CSS property. For example, if you wanted to set the font-size property, you would specify a value such as 12px, 16pt, or 1.5em.

CSS cascading: CSS  refers to the way that CSS styles are applied to HTML and XML elements. When multiple styles are applied to the same element, the styles will be "cascaded" in a particular order. This order is determined by the specificity of the selectors and the order in which the styles are defined in the CSS code.

Overall, CSS is a powerful tool that allows you to create awesome and functional web pages. By understanding how CSS selectors, you can create complex and responsive layouts that look great on all devices!

# Javascript webpage

Examples of Basic Code Output

document.write("Hello, world!");
alert("Hello, world!");
console.log("Hello, world!");

The first line document.write("Hello, world!"); uses the document.write() method to write the text "Hello, world!" to the web page. This method can be useful for quickly outputting text to the web page, but it's important to note that using document.write() can overwrite the current contents of the web page if it's used after the page has finished loading.

The second line alert("Hello, world!"); uses the alert() method to display a pop-up window with the message "Hello, world!". This method can be useful for providing users with important information or warnings.

The third line console.log("Hello, world!"); uses the console.log() method to print the message "Hello, world!" to the browser console. This method is useful for debugging and can be used to output more detailed information than what's displayed on the web page.

Overall, these methods provide different ways to output data with JavaScript depending on your needs.

Examples of Basic Input with prompting and confirming

let name = prompt("What is your name?");
let deleteItem = confirm("Are you sure you want to delete this item?");

The first line let name = prompt("What is your name?"); uses the prompt() method to display a dialog box with the message "What is your name?" and allows the user to input their name. The user's input is then stored in the name variable.

The second line let deleteItem = confirm("Are you sure you want to delete this item?"); uses the confirm() method to display a dialog box with the message "Are you sure you want to delete this item?" and two buttons: "OK" and "Cancel". If the user clicks "OK", the value true is stored in the deleteItem variable. If the user clicks "Cancel", the value false is stored in the deleteItem variable.

Both of these methods are useful for creating interactive web pages and getting user input.
